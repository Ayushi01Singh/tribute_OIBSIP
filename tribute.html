    <p>Rani Lakshmibai, 19 November 1835 - 17 June 1858, popular as Jhansi Ki Rani,
         was the queen of the Maratha-ruled lordly state of Jhansi, one of the prominent figures of the Indian Revolt of 1857,
         and an icon of resistance to British India. Jhansi Rani's original name was Manikarnika Tambe but, in Indian history as a 
        legendary figure, as the Indian 'Joan of Arc.'
         At the young age of 4, she lost her mother. As a result, her father was responsible for raising her. 
        Although completing her studies, she also received training in martial arts, including horse riding, shooting.</p>

        <h1>Rule & Revolt of Lakshmi Bai</h1>
    <p>
        The 22-year-old queen refused to hand over Jhansi to the British. Shortly after the start of the rebellion in 1857, which erupted out in
         Meerut, Lakshmi Bai was declared ruler of Jhansi and became Jhansi ki rani Lakshmi bai. She ruled on behalf of a minor heir. 
         Leading the British rebellion, she quickly organized her troops and took command of the Bundelkhand area rebels.
         Mutineers in the nearby areas moved towards Jhansi to give their support.Moving forward from Mhow, 
        Rose caught Saugor (now Sagar) in February and then shifted to Jhansi in March. The forces of the company surrounded the fort of Jhansi, 
        and a furious war raged. Offering tough resistance to the invaders, Queen of Jhansi didn't give up even after her forces were outnumbered. 
        The rescue army of Tantia Tope, another rebel leader, was beaten in the Battle of Betwa. With a small force of palace guards, Lakshmi Bai 
        managed to flee from the fort and went east, where other rebels joined her.</p>

    <h1>Death of Rani Lakshmi Bai </h1>
       <p> Tantia Tope and Lakshmi Bai launched a successful attack on the city fortress of Gwalior. The treasury and arsenal were confiscated,
         and Nana Sahib, a popular chief, was proclaimed the Peshwa (ruler). After taking Gwalior, Lakshmi Bai marched east to Morar to face a 
         British counterattack led by Rose. Dressed as a man, she fought a furious battle and was killed in battle. It is assumed that her funeral 
         was held on the same day near the place where she was injured. One of her maids helped to organize a fast funeral. Her father, Moropant 
         Tambey, was hanged a few days after Jhansi's fall.Her adopted son, Damodar Rao, received a grant from the British Raj and was 
         provided for, although he never got his inheritance.</p>
         <h2>SOME INTERESTING FACT:</h2>
         <P>Rani Lakshmi Bai became the ruler of Jhansi at the age of 18. She was given a new name in honor of Goddess Lakshmi.<br>
            In 1942, the Rani Jhansi Regiment was a women’s unit of the Indian National Army.<br>
            Rani Lakshmi Bai’s former residence has been converted into a museum to preserve memory from generation to generation.<br>
            The museum is known as Rani Mahal. Archaeological artworks and sculptures date back to the 9th and 12th centuries.<br>
            Two postage stamps were issued, in 1957, to honor the birth of the rebellion.<br>
            Her tomb is in Gwalior’s Phool Bagh area.</P>
